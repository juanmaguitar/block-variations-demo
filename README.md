The goal of this repos is to show how the registration of block variations works from a WordPress plugin.
It also loads a **custom logger for block variations** that helps to understand the variations available for selected blocks and which one is considered active based on the settings of the block. 



## Usage

- Clone this repo inside of the `plugins` folder of your WordPress installation
- Activate the `Block Variation Demo` plugin
- Open a post in edit mode and play with the block variations available
